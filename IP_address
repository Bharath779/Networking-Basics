IP_address (Internet Protocal) :
  Its a unique address given to the device to identify the device in the Network.

Types of IP_address
1.IPV4
2.IPv6

  Based on the range of IP_address its Classified into different Types
     < 192.64.32.0/8  ---> Class A  i.e get we get Ip range from 192.0.0.0 to 192.255.255.255
     < 192.64.32.0/16 ---> Class B  i.e get we get Ip range from 192.64.0.0 to 192.64.255.255
     < 192.64.32.0/24 ---> Class C  i.e get we get Ip range from 192.64.32.0 to 192.64.32.255
     
 CIDR : Classless Inter Domain Routing(without classifying  class)
< Its way of defining IP_address

IPV4 :
 < Its a protocal to create a IP_address
 < Its Usually having 4 bytes,and 1 byte is seperated by . ie 192.65.32.11
 < 1 byte = 8 bits 
 < 1 bit = 0/1
 < therefore 4 bytes = 32 bits
 lets try an Example
 consider 192.64.32.16 lets Write this in binary from
 11000000 01000000 00100000 00010000
 --------|--------|--------|--------|
  Note: 1 byte can have maximun of 255 & Minimum of 0 its range from [0-255]

To Check IP_address of your PC use Use command in command Prompt ----> ipconfig
