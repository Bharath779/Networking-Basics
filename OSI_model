OSI: Open Source Interconnection

< DNS (Domain Name System): 
     < Its a name given to the IP_address like 8.8.8.8 is IP_address of google
      we use 8.8.8.8 is IP_address as google.com(DNS)

< TCP Handshaking:
  Its usually used to secure communication in the Internet
  how its works 
     <1st its sends syn(request) to the server.
     < 2nd server send back the syn ack(response).
     < 3nd syn ack(response) is ack(accepected).

OSI: Open Source Interconnection
< its used for understading device network communication.
< Its having 7 layer
Lets consider we are requesting something in the Internet.
 < Layer 7: Application Layer 
            < its determines the what kind of request we are sending like https, SSH

 < Layer 6: Presentation Layer
            < its used encrypting/formating the data takes place.

 < Layer 5: Session Layer
            < its used to create session with server usaually used aviod authentication again agian.

 < Layer 4: Transport Layer
            < In this layer data segmentation(spliting) happens and also protocol is used (TCP/UDP).

 < Layer 3: Networking Layer
            < In this segmented data commes to router(tower) and source IP_Address and Destination IP_PAddress are identified and make packets.

 < Layer 2: Data Link Layer
            < In this if you are using the router its converted into packets if we are using switches its converted into frames.

 < Layer 1: Physical Layer
            < In this layer with help of optical fibers data is send to server.
