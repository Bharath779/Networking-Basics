Subnet (subnetworking):
  Its nothing but dividing the larger N/w into smaller N/w
  i.e Lets Consider 
    IP has 192.64.32.0
    in this IP we require only 255 ips
    so we larger IP_address 192.64.32.0 into samller 192.64.32.0/24
    i.e 192.64.32.0/24
    32-24=8 i.e 2^8 =256 IPs.
    so we got required ips .
